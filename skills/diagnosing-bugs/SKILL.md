# Diagnosing Bugs

A discipline for hard bugs. Scale effort to uncertainty; record skipped or unavailable checks without blocking independent useful work.

When exploring the codebase, read `GLOSSARY.md` (if it exists) to get a clear mental model of the relevant modules, and check ADRs in the area you're touching.

## Redact

This skill has you show commands, outputs and captured artifacts. **Redact every secret first**: write `<REDACTED>` in its place. Build loops against env vars, so the credential stays in the environment rather than in what you show. Captured artifacts carry auth headers: quote only the lines that carry the signal.

If the redacted output is not enough to diagnose the bug, say so and ask the user.

## Phase 1: Build a feedback loop

**This is the skill.** Everything else is mechanical. If you have a **tight** pass/fail signal for the bug (one that goes red on _this_ bug), you will find the cause; bisection, hypothesis-testing, and instrumentation all just consume it. If none is available, inspect source and captured evidence to develop explicitly provisional explanations.

Prioritize a useful feedback loop, but bound effort by available access, task value, runtime and resource limits.

### Ways to construct one, in roughly this order

1. **Failing test** at whatever seam reaches the bug: unit, integration, e2e.
2. **Curl / HTTP script** against a running dev server.
3. **CLI invocation** with a fixture input, diffing stdout against a known-good snapshot.
4. **Headless browser script** (Playwright / Puppeteer) that drives the UI and asserts on DOM/console/network.
5. **Replay a captured trace.** Save a real network request / payload / event log to disk; replay it through the code path in isolation.
6. **Focused harness.** Spin up a minimal subset of the system (one service, mocked deps) that exercises the bug code path with a single function call.
7. **Property / fuzz loop.** If the bug is "sometimes wrong output", run a bounded, seeded input campaign and look for the failure mode.
8. **Bisection harness.** If the bug appeared between two known states (commit, dataset, version), automate "boot at state X, check, repeat" so you can `git bisect run` it.
9. **Differential loop.** Run the same input through old-version vs new-version (or two configs) and diff outputs.
10. **HITL bash script.** Last resort. If a human must click, drive _them_ with `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh` so the loop is still structured. Captured output feeds back to you.

A precise feedback loop makes later diagnosis and verification much stronger.

### Tighten the loop

Treat the loop as a product. Once you have _a_ loop, **tighten** it:

- Can I make it faster? (Cache setup, skip unrelated init, narrow the test scope.)
- Can I make the signal sharper? (Assert on the specific symptom, not "didn't crash".)
- Can I make it more deterministic? (Pin time, seed RNG, isolate filesystem, freeze network.)

A 30-second flaky loop is barely better than no loop; a 2-second deterministic one is tight, a debugging superpower.

### Non-deterministic bugs

- Measure reproduction rate and record attempts, failures, seeds, environment and timing.
- Increase the rate with bounded repetition, controlled scheduling, fault injection or stress in an isolated environment. Respect runtime and concurrency limits; do not stress production without authorization.
- A rare failure still carries evidence. Distinguish “not observed in N attempts” from proof of absence.

### When you genuinely cannot build a loop

- State what was tried and the exact missing access or artifact.
- Continue source inspection and analysis of redacted captured evidence; label hypotheses and unverified fixes clearly.
- Request only what blocks the remaining work, such as a redacted trace or access to a reproducing environment. Production instrumentation requires appropriate authorization.

### Preferred completion criterion when reproduction is available

For the reproducible path, aim for a loop that is **tight** and **red-capable**: you can name **one command** (a script path, a test invocation, a curl) that you have **already run at least once** (show the invocation and its output, redacted), and that is:

- [ ] **Red-capable**: it drives the actual bug code path and asserts the **user's exact symptom**, so it can go red on this bug and green once fixed. Not "runs without erroring"; it must be able to _catch this specific bug_.
- [ ] **Deterministic**: same verdict every run (flaky bugs: a pinned, high reproduction rate, per above).
- [ ] **Fast**: as fast as practical without excluding the real failure path.
- [ ] **Agent-runnable**: you can run it unattended; use `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh` as an optional scaffold when a human action is unavoidable.

Source reading and provisional hypotheses may be necessary to build the loop. Record whether the exact symptom has actually been reproduced; do not claim it from a nearby passing check.

## Phase 2: Reproduce + minimise

When a runnable reproduction is available, run the loop and confirm the failure. When unavailable, bypass reproduction-dependent gates in phases 2, 5 and 6; continue evidence-backed diagnosis, record unverified checks and do not claim the original symptom is fixed.

Confirm:

- [ ] The loop produces the failure mode the **user** described, not a different failure that happens to be nearby. Wrong bug = wrong fix.
- [ ] The failure is reproducible across multiple runs (or, for non-deterministic bugs, reproducible at a high enough rate to debug against).
- [ ] You have captured the exact symptom (error message, wrong output, slow timing) so later phases can verify the fix actually addresses it.

### Minimise

Once it's red, shrink the repro to the **smallest scenario that still goes red**. Cut inputs, callers, config, data, and steps **one at a time**, re-running the loop after each cut, and keep only what's load-bearing for the failure.

Why bother: a minimal repro shrinks the hypothesis space in Phase 3 (fewer moving parts left to suspect) and becomes the clean regression test in Phase 5.

Minimize until the scenario is understandable and stable; stop shrinking when further effort adds little diagnostic value. Preserve the original scenario for final verification.

## Phase 3: Hypothesise

Rank the plausible competing hypotheses; avoid anchoring, but do not invent alternatives to meet a quota.

Each hypothesis must be **falsifiable**: state the prediction it makes.

> Format: "If <X> is the cause, then <changing Y> will make the bug disappear / <changing Z> will make it worse."

If the explanation has no discriminating prediction, sharpen it or label it untestable with the available access; do not present it as established.

**Show the ranked list to the user before testing.** They often have domain knowledge that re-ranks instantly ("we just deployed a change to #3"), or know hypotheses they've already ruled out. Cheap checkpoint, big time saver. Don't block on it; proceed with your ranking if the user is AFK.

## Phase 4: Instrument

Each probe must map to a specific prediction from Phase 3. **Change one variable at a time.**

Tool preference:

1. **Debugger / REPL inspection** if the env supports it. One breakpoint beats ten logs.
2. **Targeted logs** at the boundaries that distinguish hypotheses.
3. Never "log everything and grep".

**Tag every debug log** with a unique prefix, e.g. `[DEBUG-a4f2]`. Cleanup at the end becomes a single grep. Untagged logs survive; tagged logs die.

**Perf branch.** For performance regressions, logs are usually wrong. Instead: establish a baseline measurement (timing harness, `performance.now()`, profiler, query plan), then bisect. Measure first, fix second.

## Phase 5: Fix + regression test

Write the regression test **before the fix**, but only if there is a **correct seam** for it.

A correct seam is one where the test exercises the **real bug pattern** as it occurs at the call site. If the only available seam is too shallow (single-caller test when the bug needs multiple callers, unit test that can't replicate the chain that triggered the bug), a regression test there gives false confidence.

**If no correct seam exists, that itself is the finding.** Note it. The codebase architecture is preventing the bug from being locked down. Flag this for the next phase.

If a correct seam exists:

1. Turn the minimised repro into a failing test at that seam.
2. Watch it fail.
3. Apply the fix.
4. Watch it pass.
5. Re-run the Phase 1 feedback loop against the original (un-minimised) scenario.

## Phase 6: Cleanup

For a verified fix, complete the available checks below. Without reproduction, explicitly report a provisional fix or diagnosis and the outstanding original-scenario verification:

- [ ] Original repro no longer reproduces (re-run the Phase 1 loop)
- [ ] Regression test passes (or absence of seam is documented)
- [ ] All `[DEBUG-...]` instrumentation removed (`grep` the prefix)
- [ ] Useful authored harnesses, reproductions and benchmarks retained in persistent project locations; temporary debug instrumentation removed
- [ ] The hypothesis that turned out correct is stated in the commit / PR message, so the next debugger learns
